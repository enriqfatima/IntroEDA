# PreEDA
##### Data:
In this project, I used the data from : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv which details properties of candies such as if they are chocolate,fruity,caramel,nougat,hard,their sugarpercent etc.
##### Methods:
Alike, I used my ability to gather data from my source to efficiently handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality and reliability.
For data visualization, I created some charts and graphs to explore data relationships/trends using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
With my knowledge of statistical analysus, I was able to apply some of the basic concepts to summarize and interpret my data. This project further aided in my programming skills in the Python language which is great for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
