## NumpyMatPlotLibR.ipynb
##### Data:
In this project, I used the data from : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv which details properties of candies such as if they are chocolate,fruity,caramel,nougat,hard,their sugarpercent etc.
##### Methods:
Alike, I used my ability to gather data from my source to efficiently handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality and reliability.
For data visualization, I created some charts and graphs to explore data relationships/trends using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
With my knowledge of statistical analysis, I was able to apply some of the basic concepts to summarize and interpret my data. This project further aided in my programming skills in the Python language which is great for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## DataAnalysis
##### Data:
In this project, I utilized data obtained from my university's Data Science course, which encompassed various demographic factors such as majors, gender, and age.
##### Methods:
Building upon the methodologies employed in previous projects, I delved into the intricacies of the dataset to uncover meaningful insights. Specifically, I focused on comparative analyses between different majors, such as cognitive science and computer science, to discern patterns and trends within the data. By employing statistical techniques and visualization tools, I elucidated key relationships and correlations inherent in the dataset. Furthermore, I refined my proficiency in data manipulation and analysis using Python, solidifying my foundation in this versatile programming language. This project not only augmented my analytical skills but also deepened my understanding of the complexities involved in interpreting real-world data, thereby enhancing my capabilities as a data scientist.
